# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution in several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
It is based in a combination of readings and discussion, a small statistics lab, and a self-defined project.
The course readings will require preparing reports on a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
This will help students examine what the HCI community considers a research contribution across a variety of problems,
thus preparing students to understand and make meaningful research contributions in these and other areas of HCI.
